### EU-funded contract as a reference

The indicator tells if the contracting authority, with regard to technical and professional capacity requires references "financed by EU-funds" (which might be an unduly restriction of competition).

### Framework agreement with a single bidder

### Rate of bid bond/estimated value is too high

The indicator tells if the bid bond required by the contracting authority exceeds a limit (2%) compared to the estimated value of procurement, as demanding a too high bid bond might restrict competition.

### (Partially) unsuccessful procedure - without any grounds

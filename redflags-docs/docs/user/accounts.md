# User accounts on the RED FLAGS website

**To get access to the data, you must have a registered and activated account on the *Red Flags* website.** [Registration](#registration) is **free** and takes at most 2 minutes.

Every user management related function (login, registration, password change request) has a **Captcha** box which must be filled in to proceed. It is needed to avoid crawlers.


## Registration

You can register on the [login page](http://www.redflags.eu/register), using the *"I don't have an account"* box. You must provide your name, your e-mail address and a password.

Your password will **not** be stored in plain text format, it will be encoded securely. Your e-mail address and username will remain **hidden** from other users.

After clicking the *Register* button, *Red Flags* will send you an **activation e-mail** which will contain a link inside. Click on the link to activate your account and then you can login.

You must activate your account **within 24 hours** or the registration will be invalid. Invalid registrations are not being deleted immediately though, you can request account activation manually by [contacting us](../#contact).


## Logging in and out

Use the [login page](http://www.redflags.eu/login) to log in on the *Red Flags* website. You can find the login link in the **top right corner**, but when you click any link that needs authorization, the site will redirect you to the login page.

When you are logged in, the top right corner shows your username and the logout link.


## Forgotten password

In case you forgot your password, choose the *"I forgot my password"* option on the [login page](http://www.redflags.eu/forgot) and provide your registered e-mail address.

*Red Flags* will send you an **e-mail with a link** inside, which will take you to a form where you can enter your new password.

This option is also alive for only **24 hours**. After that, you can request password change again with the same steps described above.


## Account deletion

Currently there is no option for it, but if you want your account to be removed, please request it via [e-mail](../#contact).

# Browsing organizations on the RED FLAGS website



Organizations come from the following parts of documents:

* contracting authority
* award winners



## Using organization list



The [list of organizations](http://www.redflags.eu/organizations) can be reached from the welcome page or from the header on any page by clicking on the *"Organizations"* link.

Organization list is very similar to the [list of notices](#using-notice-list).

The *list footer* is completely the same and the *list header* has only a few differences:

* Currently there's no multiple options for ordering the organizations, they are **ordered by name**.
* Also there aren't as much filter options for a whole panel, there's only a [name filter](#filtering-organizations).

The *data table* is a simple one, it has only two columns:

* The first column shows the **name** of the organization, which is a link to the [organization page](#organization-details).
* The second columns shows the following counters:
	* the **count of tenders** the organization appeared in as the **contracting authority**
	* the **count of tenders** the organization appeared in as an **award winner**

Counters having zero value will not be printed.



## Filtering organizations



As I mentioned above, you can filter organizations **by name**. Use the text input box on the right side of the *list header* in the [organization list](#using-organization-list) page.

The search will work as mentioned [here](/user/notices/#text-search-method).



## Organization details



Clicking on an organization's name everywhere on the site will lead you to its details page. These pages have the following panels:

* **Basic data** - Name and categoritation of the organization.
* **Calls** - The top 10 freshest contract notice where this organization was the contracting authority.
* **Winnings** - The top 10 freshest contract award notice where this organization appears in as an award winner.

These lists have a similar structure you see on the [notice list pages](/user/notices/#using-notice-list).
Below the top 10 lists, you can click on the link to get the full list. These links are basically filters which use the organization ID in the appropriate field.
